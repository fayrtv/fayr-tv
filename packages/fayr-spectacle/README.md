# NextJS + TS + MantineUI + Web3 Starter

My Web3 frontend starter kit.

- [x] Uses my favourite `prettier` and `vscode` settings.
- [x] Supports SASS/SCSS.
- [x] Supports light/dark theme switching via Mantine Themes.
- [x] Mantine Theme override provided.
- [x] Notifications via Mantine Notifications.

## Usage

Just `yarn install` and then follow NextJS instructions. Basically, `yarn run dev` to start development on your localhost.
